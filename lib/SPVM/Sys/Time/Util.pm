=head1 Class Methods

=head2 nanoseconds_to_timespec

C<static method nanoseconds_to_timespec : L<Sys::Time::Timespec|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timespec> ($nanoseconds : long);>

Converts nanoseconds $nanoseconds to a L<Sys::Time::Timespec|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timespec> object, and returns it.

Exceptions:

$nanoseconds must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

Converts the L<Sys::Time::Timespec|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timespec> object $ts to nanoseconds, and returns it.

This method could cause overflow.

Exceptions:

$ts->tv_sec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

$ts->tv_nsec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

C<static method timeval_to_microseconds : double ($tv : L<Sys::Time::Timeval|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timeval>);>

Converts the L<Sys::Time::Timeval|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timeval> object $tv to microseconds, and returns it.

This method could cause overflow.

Exceptions:

$tv->tv_sec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

$tv->tv_usec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 float_seconds_to_timespec

C<static method float_seconds_to_timespec : L<Sys::Time::Timespec|SPVM::Sys::Time::Timespec> ($float_seconds : double);>

This method may result in a loss of precision.

Exceptions:

$float_seconds must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

This method may result in a loss of precision.

Exceptions:

$ts->tv_sec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

$ts->tv_nsec must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.
